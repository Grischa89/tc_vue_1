            <h2 class="article__subheading">Items</h2>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Receiving gifts from your Pok&eacute;mon GO Friends is a helpful way of getting important items. Especially Trainers with few Pok&eacute;stops around benefit from the gifts they receive from friends. Are you a Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainer from a rather rural area?! Then listen up! Because getting Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainer Codes might be as important as another Pok&eacute;stop 5 blocks away.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Oftentimes you will receive regular items from gifts like regular Pok&eacute;balls, Potions and Revives. But in the long run it comes in handy to have better items in storage. Especially when you plan a few Raids during Raid Hour or the next Community Day is around the corner it makes sense to restock the amount of better items. Exchanging gifts with other Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainers will give you a good chance to receive Great Balls and Ultra Balls as well as Super Potions, Hyper Potions, Max Potions and Max Revives.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Other items you can get from gifts of your Pok&eacute;mon GO Friends are 7 km Eggs, Berries or Evolution Items. So watch out for those, too! Just click on the Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainer Code you want to send an invitation to. It will be saved to your clipboard automatically and can easily be pasted! Just give it a try!
            </p>
            <h2 class="article__subheading">Research Tasks</h2>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Remember the recent event in celebration of World Tourism Day? The research tasks of that event laid a strong focus on friendships. Tasks from future events might differ, but last September those tasks included:
            </p>
            <ul class="article__listarray">
                <li class="article__listarray__item">Trade a Pok&eacute;mon caught 10.000 km apart</li>
                <li class="article__listarray__item">Make a new friend</li>
                <li class="article__listarray__item">Send 25 gifts to friends</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                So, in order for example to accomplish the first task either you or the Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainer you want to trade with needs a Pok&eacute;mon that is 10.000 km apart from the location you&apos;re at. Either one of you travels a lot (Congratulations!) or you just open a gift from a Pok&eacute;mon GO Friend of another continent and receive a 7 km Egg (of course only when you have a spare spot). The Pok&eacute;mon that hatches out the 7 km Egg will have the location of the Pok&eacute;mon GO Friend you received it from. Et voil√†! For that matter trainercodes.net will be super helpful because of its clear table layout that lists the Trainer Codes according to the continents the Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainers come from! With clicking on a Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainer Code or the icon next to it the Trainer Code will be copied to your clipboard. You just need to paste it in the enter field and there you go!
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                While the benefits of easy-to-get Trainer Codes are evident for the second of the above research tasks they will be explained for the last one. Because: Who wouldn&apos;t like to accomplish a research task that rewards you with a Lapras encounter that has the chance of being shiny? Right?! So just send 25 gifts to 25 friends. Done? No?! Well, we all have some lazy Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainers in our friends lists that are not that reliable when it comes to opening gifts. But in order for you being able to send gifts, it is crucial that others open the old gifts first.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                With trainercodes.net this problem is not likely to occur again. Just pick some Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainer Codes from the tables above and send them invitations! The Trainer Codes come from active Pok&eacute;mon GO Trainers that are likely to accept the invitation you just sent them. Give it a try right now: One click on the Trainer Code you&apos;d like to send an invitation to or on the icon next to it will copy the Trainer Code to your clipboard. So you just have to paste it in the Trainer Code section in the Pok&eacute;mon GO App and there you go: You are just a few steps away from your hopefully shiny Lapras encounter (or whichever Pok&eacute;mon it will be next time)!
